# BikePoweredYoutubeVideo
Connect your bluetooth LE enabled bike or use a dongle to play youtube videos only while you're pedalling on your stationary bike.

# How to use:
Press the copy button on this page https://github.com/roshkins/BikePoweredYoutubeVideo/blob/main/BluetoothBike.js and paste the code into the developer console of any youtube video, start pedalling and your computer should detect your bike, and you will be forced to pedal to watch the video. If you go super fast you fast-forward. Happy biking!
